# Introduction to Privacy Preserving Machine Learning

## Overview

This one-hour live webinar will introduce participants to the fundamentals of Privacy Preserving
Machine Learning (`PPML`). The session will introduce key PPML concepts such as Federated Learning,
Differential Privacy, and Homomorphic Encryption, giving participants a foundational understanding
of how to balance privacy and transparency with the effectiveness of ML models. During the webinar,
attendees will get practical insights into integrating privacy-preserving techniques into ML
workflows using PySyft - an open source tool for secure and private machine learning.
